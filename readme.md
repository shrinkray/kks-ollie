## Developer Notes

The KKS Ollie theme works out of the box and intended to modify the parent, Ollie. However, the author included a Composer file that is used for linting to PHP and WordPress core standards. I believe this will work with this version of the child theme.

- `composer run lint`
- `composer run wpcs:scan`
- `composer run wpcs:fix`
